	  <p style="border-left:10px solid red;padding:8px 8px;">Smart home technology has taken turns and stretches towards both improving the effectiveness of catering to our basic needs and availability.
Coming from vacuum cleaners and simple electrical laundry machines to computer-controlled Air conditioning, automatic lighting systems, etc and will both be continuing to be more commonly used and provided in older and newer homes.</p>
	  
	  <!-- Part A Information -->
        <p style="border-left:10px solid Blue;padding:8px 8px;">Smart home technology or "Total electrical home" was an idea thought of from 1920 to 1930 but never was placed into action. Simple appliances such as Electrical washing machines, Clothing iron, vacuum cleaner, and other things were considered "Smart home technology". Going towards the 1950s the idea of a fully electrical home (Smart-home) was put in place in 1950-1956 (Video link here: Westinghouse All-Electric House (Color) - YouTube) but was only for the wealthy elite class. 

Smart home technology basics were more commonly provided to the public in the 1970s such as Termastats to control heating, computer-controlled laundry machines, etc. Advanced technology was still reserved for the wealthy.

Coming to 2010 smart home basic became more available to the public and advanced technology became more available to the public almost close to 2022.

And currently, in 2022 we have the availability to buy door controllers, automatic light sensors, and so on without having to pre-install them in the homes.</p>
     
        <!-- Part B Information -->
        
		<p style="border-left:10px solid green;padding:8px 8x;">In the future, I predict Smart home technology will improve in its Ai assistant (Example: Google home, Eufy Home Assistance, Seri) to be more welcoming or perform more advanced voice commands like 

-Setting a room temperature with the word or sentences: "I feel cold here", "I feel hot here".

-Advanced Ai's assisting you with maintaining a schedule (Something like a charming tone to remind you it's time to work or free time) 

-The Ai can help reduce power usage for unused rooms by monitoring your activities. (It's a security hazard honestly)
